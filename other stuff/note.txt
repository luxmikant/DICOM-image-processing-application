Morphological Component Analysis (MCA):
• This technique decomposes an image into distinct components (for example, separating “cartoon” parts that reflect general structure from “texture” parts containing fine details).
• By isolating features and reducing redundant, non-diagnostic information, MCA enhances image contrast and highlights regions that may be indicative of disease.

Weighted Guided Image Filtering:
• A refined version of guided filtering that assigns higher weight to edge regions, preserving important anatomical boundaries while reducing background noise.
• This leads to images with clear, defined edges that help reveal subtle abnormalities in tissue structure.

Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Haar Transform Based Methods:
• DWT can decompose an image into frequency sub-bands (e.g., low-low, high-high) so that key features are enhanced while noise is suppressed.
• When combined with techniques like alpha blending (as used in steganographic approaches), the method ensures that contrast improvements are maintained and that hidden textural or morphological details (that might indicate disease) are more visible.

Contrast Enhancement Techniques (e.g., Adaptive Histogram Equalization or CLAHE):
• These methods locally adjust image contrast, making the differences between healthy and abnormal tissues more prominent.
• They are particularly effective in images that suffer from low contrast due to inherent noise or imaging artifacts.

Edge-Preserving Denoising Methods:
• Techniques like anisotropic diffusion or bilateral filtering reduce noise while preserving important edges.
• Preserved boundaries can improve a clinician’s ability to detect lesions or structural abnormalities in the tissue.

Gabor Filters and Stroke Width Transform:
• Gabor filtering is used to extract orientation-specific features from the image. It is beneficial in highlighting patterns or textures associated with certain pathologies.
• Stroke width transforms help detect and quantify textural elements, which may be critical in diagnosing diseases with textural imbalances or subtle signs.

Together, these advanced pre‑processing methods help generate enhanced, high‑quality images where important details are preserved and noise is minimized. The clearer delineation of anatomical structures and abnormalities leads to a more “clear cut” visual presentation for the doctor, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy and overall patient care.
